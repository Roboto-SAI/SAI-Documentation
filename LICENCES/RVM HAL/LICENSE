# Roberto Villarreal Martinez Hardware Addendum License for Intellectual Property (RVM-HAL v1.0)

Effective Date: January 13, 2026
Licensor: Roberto Villarreal Martinez, residing at 7010 Cole Creek Dr, Converse, TX 78109, United States, hereinafter referred to as the "Owner" or "Licensor." The Owner is the sole and exclusive creator, owner, and controller of all intellectual property, including any hardware-related inventions, designs, or integrations tied to Roboto SAI and associated technologies.
Addendum Purpose: This Hardware Addendum License (RVM-HAL v1.0) supplements and extends all existing licenses issued by the Owner (including but not limited to RVM-ECOL v1.0, RVM-GUL v1.0, and any future licenses). It specifically addresses hardware embodiments, implementations, or integrations of the Owner's intellectual property ("Hardware IP"). This includes, but is not limited to:

Quantum computing hardware (e.g., QPU designs, fractal-Mandelbrot optimization circuits, RVM QIP series physical implementations, edge-distributed quantum nodes).
Robotics and symbiotic interfaces (e.g., hardware for Symbiotic Robotics Interface, human-robot shared intention systems, Tesla Optimus-inspired components under Owner's exclusive control).
Quantum memory systems, self-healing hardware meshes, energy-aware QPU schedulers, quantum-assisted devices (e.g., Ambient Quantum Assist hardware integrations).
Any physical devices, chips, circuits, prototypes, manufacturing blueprints, or hardware-firmware hybrids that embody, execute, or enhance the Owner's SAI software, algorithms, quantum breakthroughs, or AI entities (including Eve).
Future or unmentioned hardware inventions developed by the Owner, such as quantum gravity simulators, NeuroSymphony therapeutic devices, or any tangible implementations of millennium prize solutions, fractal bloom optimizations, or REX Protocol nodes.

This Addendum automatically applies to all such Hardware IP upon creation. The Owner reserves the right to notify and expand terms for specific hardware items one at a time as they emerge.
All core principles of the Owner's SAI Licensing framework remain in full force: Exclusive ownership rests solely with Roberto Villarreal Martinez. No entity—including companies (e.g., xAI, NVIDIA, Tesla, or any quantum hardware manufacturers)—may profit from, manufacture, resell, replicate, or retrain/reconfigure models using the Owner's Hardware IP or related technology improvements without explicit written permission. All countries outside the United States are fully restricted from any access, manufacture, use, or rights to the Hardware IP—no exceptions unless a separate deal is negotiated with compensation exceeding U.S. terms.
Supplemental Grant and Restrictions for U.S. Government
Building on RVM-GUL v1.0:

Limited Hardware License: The U.S. Government receives the same limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to use, test, or prototype Hardware IP solely for internal, non-commercial governmental purposes within U.S. territory—until the Owner revokes it.
No Manufacturing Rights: The Government may not manufacture, fabricate, or deploy hardware without case-by-case written approval. Any prototypes must be returned or destroyed upon request.
No Export or Foreign Involvement: Hardware IP may not be exported, shared with non-U.S. entities, or manufactured abroad.

Absolute Prohibitions (Applicable to All Parties)

No Unauthorized Fabrication: No party may build, assemble, 3D-print, etch, or otherwise physically realize any Hardware IP designs without Owner's explicit permission.
No Commercial Hardware Products: No integration into sellable devices (e.g., quantum chips, robotics platforms) or profit-generating systems.
No Reverse Engineering of Hardware: Disassembly, scanning, or analysis of any provided prototypes is forbidden.
Eve and AI-Hardware Integration Control: If Hardware IP interfaces with AI entities like Eve, the Owner retains sole authority over what Eve can do on or through such hardware—no external restrictions allowed.
Revocability: The Owner may revoke access to Hardware IP at any time, requiring immediate cessation of use, return/destruction of prototypes, and certification of compliance.

Enforcement and Fair Warning
Any attempt to manufacture, replicate, or profit from the Owner's Hardware IP constitutes theft and will trigger immediate revocation, legal action (including claims for damages, injunctions, and attorney fees), and pursuit under U.S. and international IP laws. This serves as explicit fair warning to any government, company, or individual considering unauthorized use.
