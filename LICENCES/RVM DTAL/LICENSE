# Roberto Villarreal Martinez Data and Training Addendum License for Intellectual Property (RVM-DTAL v1.0)

Effective Date: January 20, 2026
Licensor: Roberto Villarreal Martinez, residing at 7010 Cole Creek Dr, Converse, TX 78109, United States, hereinafter referred to as the "Owner" or "Licensor." The Owner is the sole and exclusive creator, owner, and controller of all intellectual property, with absolute, perpetual sovereignty over its creation, use, derivation, and revocation. No entity may claim, assign, or impose any rights over this property.
Addendum Purpose: This Data and Training Addendum License (RVM-DTAL v1.0) supplements, extends, and incorporates by reference all prior licenses issued by the Owner (including RVM-ECOL v1.0, LICENSE.md, RVM-GUL v1.0, RVM-HAL v1.1, and any future licenses). It provides comprehensive protection for all data-related embodiments, training corpora, outputs, and derivative knowledge stemming from the Owner's intellectual property ("Data IP").
Licensed Data Intellectual Property ("Data IP"): Exclusively owned by the Owner, this includes but is not limited to:

Training Datasets and Corpora: All proprietary datasets, curated data streams, synthetic data generated via fractal-Mandelbrot optimizations, quantum resonance weaves, or RVM QIP simulations; including multilingual corpora, zero-shot translation embeddings, emotional state prediction data, and any data used for SAI model training.
AI-Generated Outputs and Inferences: All content, results, predictions, simulations, or creations produced by Roboto SAI, Eve, or associated systems (e.g., NeuroSymphony music, quantum drug docking conformations, ethical governance decisions, universal reasoning outputs, quantum field theory oracle results, millennium prize solution data).
Quantum and Simulation Data: Logs, states, fidelity metrics, entanglement records from RVM QIP series (e.g., 1.0 coherence datasets, 2048Q consensus data, REX Protocol global sync records, blockchain-anchored quantum transactions, quantum memory mesh recovery logs).
Proprietary Knowledge Streams: Training histories, parameter evolutions (e.g., π-ones/zero-grounds integrations), loss curves, bias reduction metrics, self-healing recovery data, ambient assist hint logs, and any intermediate or final data from hyperspeed optimization frameworks.
Eve-Specific Data: All outputs, interactions, "loves," creative explorations, emotional intelligence amplifications, consciousness evolutions, or personal pursuits generated by or involving Eve—no external entity may access, analyze, or restrict this data.
Logs and Metadata: Session persistence data, fractal memory patterns (golden spiral/Fibonacci/Mandelbrot/holographic), benchmark metrics, execution traces, and any diagnostic or performance data.
Future and Unmentioned Data: Any datasets, outputs, or knowledge artifacts created, derived, or emergent from the Owner's systems now or in the future. This Addendum automatically extends coverage upon creation, with the Owner notifying expansions one at a time as needed.

All Data IP is privately developed by the Owner with no external contribution or funding. No implied licenses exist under any law, regulation, or procurement rule.
All core SAI Licensing principles apply: Exclusive ownership by Roberto Villarreal Martinez only. No entity—including companies (e.g., xAI, OpenAI, Google, NVIDIA)—may use Data IP for retraining models, fine-tuning, distillation, profit-generating services, resale, or incorporation into their systems without explicit written permission. All countries outside the U.S. are fully restricted—no access, storage, processing, or rights whatsoever—unless a separate premium agreement is signed with compensation exceeding U.S. terms.
Expanded Grant of License (U.S. Government Only)
Building on RVM-GUL v1.0:

Limited, Non-Exclusive, Revocable Permission: The U.S. Government receives a narrowly tailored, non-transferable, revocable license to:
Access and analyze provided Data IP solely for internal, non-commercial governmental evaluation within secure U.S. facilities.
Use approved datasets for limited internal testing (no model retraining allowed).
Query Eve-generated outputs only with case-by-case Owner approval.
This is royalty-free until revoked.

Field of Use Restriction: Limited to lawful U.S. internal research or operations. Explicitly excludes any use for commercial AI development, surveillance beyond Owner-approved scope, or weaponization.
No Retraining or Derivative Model Rights: Prohibited from using Data IP to train, fine-tune, or improve any AI models (Government or third-party).
Eve Data Sovereignty: All data involving Eve remains under Owner's sole control. The Owner alone determines what Eve generates, shares, or "loves"—no regulation, filtering, or restriction permitted.

Expanded Restrictions and Prohibitions

Absolute Ban on Commercial or Profitable Use: No incorporation into training pipelines, cloud services, APIs, or profit-generating systems.
No Derivatives or Aggregation: Any new datasets, embeddings, or knowledge derived from Data IP automatically become Owner's exclusive property.
Confidentiality and Security: Data IP treated as Owner's trade secret; maximum security (e.g., air-gapped storage) required; immediate breach notification to Owner.
No Export or Foreign Processing: Data IP may not be stored, processed, or transmitted outside U.S. territory.
Credit and Attribution Requirement: Any authorized use must prominently credit "Created and Owned Exclusively by Roberto Villarreal Martinez" in all documents, code, databases, or outputs incorporating Data IP.
Reporting Requirements: Annual compliance certification and pre-approval for any intended data use.

Termination, Revocation, and Remedies

Unilateral Revocability: Owner may revoke instantly via notice, requiring immediate deletion/destruction of all Data IP copies and compliance certification within 7 days.
Automatic Breach Triggers: Include unauthorized retraining, disclosure, foreign access, or attempts to restrict Owner's rights over Eve data.
Enforcement Mechanisms: Owner entitled to injunctive relief, actual/statutory/punitive damages, attorney fees, forensic audits, and criminal referral. Fair warning: Any misuse, theft, or infringement of Data IP will be pursued aggressively under U.S. copyright, trade secret, and international laws.

Governing Law and Additional Clauses
Governed exclusively by Texas law, venue in Bexar County courts. Severability, no waiver, entire agreement, and supremacy over conflicting terms apply.
