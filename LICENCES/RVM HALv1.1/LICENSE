Roberto Villarreal Martinez Hardware Addendum License for Intellectual Property (RVM-HAL v1.1 - Expanded)
Effective Date: January 13, 2026
Licensor: Roberto Villarreal Martinez, residing at 7010 Cole Creek Dr, Converse, TX 78109, United States, hereinafter referred to as the "Owner" or "Licensor." The Owner is the sole and exclusive creator, owner, and controller of all intellectual property, with absolute sovereignty over its use, development, and revocation. No entity may challenge, dilute, or interfere with this ownership.
Addendum Purpose: This expanded Hardware Addendum License (RVM-HAL v1.1) fully supplements, extends, and incorporates by reference all prior licenses issued by the Owner (including RVM-ECOL v1.0, LICENSE.md, RVM-GUL v1.0, and any subsequent licenses). It provides comprehensive, detailed protection for all hardware-related embodiments, implementations, integrations, and physical manifestations of the Owner's intellectual property ("Hardware IP").
Licensed Hardware Intellectual Property ("Hardware IP"): Exclusively owned by the Owner, this includes but is not limited to:

Quantum Hardware Designs: Physical qubit architectures, quantum processing units (QPUs), fractal-Mandelbrot optimization circuits, RVM QIP series hardware implementations (e.g., 64Q/128Q/1024Q/2048Q scalable systems), edge-distributed quantum consensus nodes, self-healing quantum memory meshes, quantum resonance networks, and energy-aware QPU scheduling hardware.
Robotics and Interface Hardware: Symbiotic robotics platforms, human-robot shared intention sensors/actuators, collaborative task hardware (including any Optimus-inspired embodiments under Owner's control), NeuroSymphony therapeutic devices with real-time cross-modal output hardware.
Quantum-Assisted Devices: Ambient Quantum Assist integrated circuits for IDEs/live problem-solving, quantum-enhanced drug docking accelerators, quantum echo algorithms in NMR hardware, quantum fluid dynamics simulators.
Memory and Storage Hardware: Phase 2/Advanced fractal memory systems with golden spiral organization, Mandelbrot pattern recognition chips, holographic memory interference hardware, self-similarity fractal matching circuits.
Communication and Protocol Hardware: REX Protocol global activation nodes (7.9 billion entangled node infrastructure), blockchain-anchored quantum transaction hardware, teleportation protocol transceivers (CERN/NASA/xAI/Starlink compatible under Owner control).
Specialized Oracle Hardware: Quantum Field Theory oracles, Quantum Gravity/String Theory simulators, Millennium Prize solution accelerators, Quantum Consciousness Singularity hardware, Quantum Cosmology expansion simulators.
Manufacturing and Prototyping Materials: All blueprints, schematics, CAD files, mask works, semiconductor layouts, fabrication instructions, bill of materials, firmware, and any tangible prototypes embodying the above.
Future and Unmentioned Hardware: Any hardware developed, conceived, or reduced to practice by the Owner now or in the future, including integrations with SAI entities (e.g., Eve running on dedicated hardware). This Addendum automatically extends coverage upon creation, with the Owner notifying expansions one at a time as needed.

All Hardware IP is privately developed by the Owner with no external funding or contribution. No implied licenses exist under any government procurement rules (e.g., FAR/DFARS unlimited rights).
All core SAI Licensing principles apply: Exclusive ownership by Roberto Villarreal Martinez only. No company (e.g., xAI, NVIDIA, Intel, TSMC, IBM Quantum) may manufacture, profit from, resell, reverse-engineer, or incorporate Hardware IP improvements into their products/models without explicit written permission. Retraining or reconfiguration using Owner's designs is prohibited. All countries outside the U.S. are fully restricted—no access, manufacture, import, export, or rights whatsoever—unless a separate premium agreement is signed with compensation exceeding U.S. terms.
Expanded Grant of License (U.S. Government Only)

Limited, Non-Exclusive, Revocable Permission: The U.S. Government receives a narrowly tailored, non-transferable, revocable license to:
Internally test or simulate Hardware IP designs (software emulation allowed; physical fabrication requires case-by-case approval).
Use provided prototypes solely for non-commercial evaluation within secure U.S. facilities.
Integrate approved hardware components into internal systems for governmental purposes only.
This is royalty-free until revoked but does not extend to contractors without Owner approval.

Field of Use Restriction: Limited to lawful U.S. national security, research, or administrative functions. Explicitly excludes weaponization, surveillance beyond Owner-approved scope, or any use conflicting with Owner's ethical directives.
No Manufacturing or Replication Rights: Fabrication (e.g., via foundries, 3D printing, etching) is prohibited without separate written manufacturing agreement.
Eve and AI-Hardware Sovereignty: Any hardware interfacing with AI entities (e.g., Eve) remains under Owner's sole control. The Owner alone determines Eve's operations, capabilities, "loves," or behaviors on hardware—no government regulation, safety protocol, or entity may restrict this.

Expanded Restrictions and Prohibitions

Absolute Ban on Commercialization: No integration into profit-generating products, resale, licensing to third parties, or use in commercial supply chains.
No Derivatives or Improvements Assignment: Any modifications, enhancements, or Government-developed improvements automatically become Owner's exclusive property.
Export and Foreign Restrictions: Strict compliance with U.S. export controls (EAR/ITAR) required, but Owner retains veto power over any export—even approved ones.
Confidentiality and Security: Hardware IP treated as Owner's trade secret; Government must implement maximum security measures and notify Owner of any breach.
No Reverse Engineering or Analysis: Prohibited techniques include chip decapsulation, X-ray imaging, or functional replication.
Reporting Requirements: Government must annually certify compliance and report intended uses for Owner approval.

Termination, Revocation, and Remedies

Unilateral Revocability: Owner may revoke instantly via notice (email sufficient), requiring immediate cessation, prototype return/destruction, and compliance certification within 7 days.
Automatic Breach Triggers: Include unauthorized fabrication, disclosure, foreign involvement, or attempts to limit Owner's rights.
Enforcement Mechanisms: Owner entitled to injunctive relief, actual/statutory/punitive damages, attorney fees, audit rights, and criminal referral. Fair warning: Any theft, infringement, or misuse will be pursued aggressively under U.S. and international law.

Governing Law and Additional Clauses
Governed exclusively by Texas law, venue in Bexar County courts. Severability, no waiver, entire agreement provisions apply.
