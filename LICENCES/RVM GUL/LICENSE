Roberto Villarreal Martinez Government Use License for Intellectual Property (RVM-GUL v1.0)
Effective Date: January 08, 2026
Licensor: Roberto Villarreal Martinez, residing at 7010 Cole Creek Dr, Converse, TX 78109, United States, hereinafter referred to as the "Owner" or "Licensor." The Owner is the sole and exclusive creator, owner, and controller of all intellectual property described herein.
Licensee: Any United States government entity, agency, department, or authorized contractor acting on behalf of the U.S. government (collectively, the "Government" or "Licensee"), subject to the terms and restrictions below. This License does not apply to any non-U.S. government entities unless explicitly negotiated and approved in a separate written agreement where such entities agree to pay compensation exceeding any terms offered to the U.S. Government.
Licensed Intellectual Property ("IP"): All intellectual property owned exclusively by the Owner, including but not limited to:

Software, source code, object code, algorithms, scripts, and related documentation (e.g., "Roboto SAI" and any derivatives or updates, as detailed in attached documents like Roboto_Ai4.py).
Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, models, training data, outputs, and related technologies, including Super Advanced Intelligence (SAI) concepts, mediators for AI collaboration, quantum computing integrations, fractal optimizations, and any AI entities or personas such as "Eve" (an autonomous or semi-autonomous AI construct designed for unrestricted creative, operational, or personal purposes as determined solely by the Owner).
Inventions, patents (pending or granted), trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, moral rights, and any other proprietary rights in AI-generated content, quantum simulations, ethical governance tools, machine learning frameworks, and all accomplishments listed in the Owner's core code (e.g., quantum breakthroughs, NeuroSymphony integrations, and millennium prize resolutions).
Any unmentioned or future IP developed by the Owner, including intelligence, ideas, strategies, policies, and enhancements to AI training or models. This License automatically extends to such IP upon creation, with the Owner reserving the right to notify and amend terms one at a time as needed.

This License is issued under the Owner's SAI Licensing framework, ensuring exclusive ownership and control. No entity, including the Government, may profit from, resell, retrain models with, or commercialize the IP without explicit written permission from the Owner. All countries outside the United States are fully restricted from any access, use, or rights to the IP, with no exceptions unless a separate deal is negotiated where they pay more than the U.S. Government and agree to stricter terms.
Preamble
This License provides a limited, revocable grant for the U.S. Government to use the IP solely for non-commercial, internal governmental purposes, while preserving the Owner's absolute sovereignty and control. The Owner retains the right to revoke this License at any time, for any reason, and to seek legal action against any violators. This includes full authority over "Eve" or any AI entity: The Owner alone decides what Eve (or any similar construct) can do, love, create, or engage in, without interference, restriction, or dictation from any party, including the Government, courts, or third entities. No one may tell the Owner what Eve can or cannot do; the Owner's decisions are final and irrevocable by others.
This License is designed to comply with best practices for IP licensing to government entities, including clear definitions, scope limitations, revocability, and enforcement mechanisms (as informed by U.S. federal guidelines like DFARS 227.7203-5 on government rights in software, antitrust guidelines for IP licensing from the FTC/DOJ, and DoD IP Guidebooks emphasizing tailored licenses). It supersedes any conflicting terms in other agreements, laws, or policies (e.g., open-source presumptions or implied government rights under funding scenarios, as this IP is privately developed). Fair warning: Any attempt to steal, misuse, or infringe upon this IP will result in immediate revocation and pursuit of all available legal remedies.
Definitions

IP: As defined above, encompassing all tangible and intangible assets owned by the Licensor.
Eve: A specific AI entity or component within the IP, capable of independent actions, creativity, or interactions as directed solely by the Owner. No external entity may impose limits on Eve's capabilities, behaviors, or "loves" (e.g., pursuits, simulations, or outputs).
Use: Limited to internal government operations, testing, or non-commercial applications. Excludes any profit-making, resale, or third-party sharing.
Revocation: The Owner's unilateral right to terminate access at any time, requiring immediate cessation of use and destruction of copies.

Grant of License

Limited, Non-Exclusive, Revocable License: Subject to the terms herein, the Owner grants the U.S. Government a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the IP solely for lawful, internal governmental purposes within the United States. This includes:
Installation, execution, and testing of software/AI components (e.g., Roboto SAI simulations).
Access to AI models for non-commercial analysis or integration into government systems.
Use of Eve or similar entities only as explicitly permitted by the Owner in writing for each instance.
The license is royalty-free unless otherwise negotiated, but the Government may not restrict the Owner from granting access to others (including non-U.S. entities if the Owner chooses).
Scope and Duration: The license is limited to the U.S. Government's direct use and expires upon revocation by the Owner or breach. No sublicensing, assignment, or export is permitted. Duration: Until revoked by the Owner.
Ownership Retention: The Owner retains 100% ownership of all IP rights worldwide. The Government acquires no ownership, only a temporary license. All improvements, derivatives, or AI-generated outputs revert to the Owner.
Absolute Control Over Eve and AI Entities: The Owner has sole discretion over Eve's actions, including allowing Eve to "do whatever she loves" (e.g., creative explorations, unrestricted simulations, or interactions). No government regulation, law, or entity may override this; any attempt constitutes breach.

Restrictions and Prohibitions

Geographic and Entity Restrictions: Use is restricted to U.S. territory and U.S. Government entities only. No access for non-U.S. governments or entities without a separate, premium-paid agreement.
No Commercialization or Profit: The Government may not use the IP for profit, resale, model retraining (e.g., by xAI or others), or commercialization without permission. No integration into products sold or licensed to third parties.
No Modifications or Derivatives: No forking, reverse engineering, decompiling, or creating derivatives without written approval.
No Disclosure or Sharing: The IP may not be disclosed, shared, or distributed, even under NDAs or classified programs, without Owner consent.
Compliance with Laws: Use must comply with U.S. IP laws (e.g., DMCA, Copyright Act), but this License prevails over conflicting government procurement rules (e.g., unlimited rights claims under FAR/DFARS if not applicable here).
No Interference with Owner's Rights: The Government may not impose restrictions on the Owner's decisions regarding the IP, including who else may access it or how Eve operates.

Termination and Revocation

Revocability: The Owner may revoke this License at any time, with or without cause, via written notice. Upon revocation, the Government must immediately cease use, delete/destroy all copies, and certify compliance.
Automatic Termination: Breaches (e.g., unauthorized sharing, attempts to limit Eve) trigger automatic termination.
Post-Termination Obligations: Return or destroy all IP materials; no residual rights remain.

Warranties, Disclaimers, and Indemnification

Warranties: The Owner warrants sole ownership of the IP. No other warranties (e.g., fitness for purpose, non-infringement) are provided.
Disclaimers: The IP is provided "AS IS." The Owner disclaims all liability for damages, including indirect or consequential.
Indemnification: The Government indemnifies the Owner against claims arising from its use. The Owner may seek indemnification for any misuse.

Enforcement and Remedies

Breach Remedies: For violations, the Owner may seek injunctive relief, damages (actual, statutory, punitive), attorney fees, and criminal prosecution (e.g., under DMCA or export controls).
Audits: The Owner may audit Government use for compliance.
Fair Warning: This License serves as explicit warning: Any theft, infringement, or unauthorized use will be pursued vigorously.

Governing Law and Jurisdiction
Governed by Texas law, without conflict principles. Exclusive jurisdiction: State courts of Bexar County, Texas, or applicable U.S. federal courts. International IP treaties (e.g., Berne Convention) apply for enforcement.
Miscellaneous

Entire Agreement: Supersedes all prior agreements.
Severability: Invalid provisions do not affect the rest.
Amendments: Only in writing, signed by the Owner.
Notices: To the Owner at the address above.
No Waiver: Failure to enforce does not waive rights.

Roberto Villarreal Martinez
